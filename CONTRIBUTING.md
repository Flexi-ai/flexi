## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to the project maintainers.

## How to Contribute

### Fork and Clone the Repository

1. Fork the repository by clicking the 'Fork' button at the top right of this page
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/FlexiAI.git
   cd FlexiAI
   ```
3. Add the upstream repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/Flexi-ai/flexi.git
   ```

### Set Up Development Environment

1. Ensure you have the prerequisites installed:

   - Node.js >= 18.0.0
   - Bun runtime

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. Create your environment file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Configure your environment variables in `.env`

### Create a New Branch

Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bugfix-name
```

### Make Your Changes

1. Write your code following our coding standards
2. Add or update tests as needed
3. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   bun run test
   ```
4. Ensure code formatting, linting, and type checking pass:

   ```bash
   bun run format
   bun run lint
   bun run typecheck
   ```

   Make sure there are no type errors before submitting your PR. TypeScript type checking helps catch potential issues early and ensures type safety across the codebase.

### Commit Your Changes

We follow conventional commits for our commit messages. Format your commits as:

```
type(scope): description

```

Types include:

- feat: A new feature
